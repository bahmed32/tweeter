# TinyApp Project

I developed a Twitter clone, implementing a Single Page App (SPA) using a technology stack consisting of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. The application features dynamic content rendering, real-time updates for tweet timestamps using the timeago.js library, and seamless interaction with the server for fetching and posting tweets. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end technologies and my ability to create engaging and responsive user interfaces.
